Far off places, daring sword fights magic spells, a prince in disguise If you like it all that much, it\\'s yours But sir I insist Well, thank you. Thank you very much Look there she goes that girl is so peculiar I wonder if she\\'s feeling well With a dreamy far-off look And her nose stuck in a book What a puzzle to the rest of us is Belle Oh, isn\\'t this amazing? It\\'s my favorite part because you\\'ll see Here\\'s where she meets Prince Charming But she won\\'t discover that it\\'s him \\'til chapter three Now it\\'s no wonder that her name means \"beauty\" Her looks have got no parallel But behind that fair facade I\\'m afraid she\\'s rather odd Very diff\\'rent from the rest of us She\\'s nothing like the rest of us Yes, diff\\'rent from the rest of us is Belle Wow! You didn\\'t miss a shot, Gaston, You\\'re the greatest hunter in the whole world! I know. No beast alive stands a chance against you. Ha ha ha and no girl, for that matter. It\\'s true, LeFou.

So, why don\\'t you just ruminate, Whilst I illuminate the possibilities! Well, Ali Baba had them forty thieves, Scheherazade had a thousand tales.

Have some of column A try All of column B, I\\'m in the mood to help you, dude. You ain\\'t never had friend like me Oh my. No no. My my my. Can your friends do this? Can your friends do that? Can your friends pull this Out their little hat? Can your friends go poof? Well looky here! Can your friends go abracadabra, let her rip, And then make the sucker disappear? So don\\'t just sit there slack-jawed, buggy-eyed, I\\'m here to answer all your midnight prayers, You\\'ve got me bona fide certified; You\\'ve got a genie for charge d\\'affaires. I\\'ve got a powerful urge to help you out, So what you wish, I really wanna know? You\\'ve got a list that\\'s three miles long, no doubt, Well all you\\'ve gotta do is rub like so, and oh \\xad- Mr. Aladdin, sir, have a wish or two or three. I\\'m on the job you big nabob! You ain\\'t never had a friend, never had a friend, You ain\\'t never had a friend, never had a friend, You ain\\'t never had a friend like me.

[Moana:] Who am I? I am a girl who loves my island I\\'m the girl who loves the sea It calls me I am the daughter of the village chief We are descended from voyagers Who found their way across the world They call me I\\'ve delivered us to where we are I have journeyed farther I am everything I\\'ve learned and more Still it calls me And the call isn\\'t out there at all, it\\'s inside me It\\'s like the tide; always falling and rising I will carry you here in my heart you\\'ll remind me That come what may I know the way I am Moana! The only way to get what you want is to become a human yourself Can you do that? My dear, sweet child, that\\'s what I do It\\'s what I live for To help unfortunate merfolk like yourself Poor souls with no one else to turn to I admit that in the past I\\'ve been a nasty They weren\\'t kidding when they called me, well, a witch But you\\'ll find that nowadays I\\'ve mended all my ways Repented, seen the light, and made a switch To this And I fortunately know a little magic It\\'s a talent that I always have possessed And dear lady, please don\\'t laugh I use it on behalf Of the miserable, the lonely, and depressed (Pathetic) Poor unfortunate souls In pain, in need This one longing to be thinner That one wants to get the girl And do I help them? Yes, indeed Those poor unfortunate souls So sad, so true They come flocking to my cauldron Crying, \"Spells, Ursula, please!\" And I help them Yes I do Now it\\'s happened once or twice Someone couldn\\'t pay the price And I\\'m afraid I had to rake \\'em \\'cross the coals Yes I\\'ve had the odd complaint But on the whole I\\'ve been a saint To those poor unfortunate souls Have we got a deal? If I become human, I\\'ll never be with my father or sisters again But you\\'ll have your man Life\\'s full of tough choices, isn\\'t it? Oh, and there is one more thing We haven\\'t discussed the subject of payment But I don\\'t have- I\\'m not asking much, just a token really, a trifle What I want from you is your voice But without my voice, how can I- You\\'ll have your looks, your pretty face And don\\'t underestimate the importance of body language, ha! The men up there don\\'t like a lot of blabber They think a girl who gossips is a bore Yet on land it\\'s much preferred for ladies not to say a word And after all dear, what is idle babble for? Come on, they\\'re not all that impressed with conversation True gentlemen avoid it when they can But they dote and swoon and fawn On a lady who\\'s withdrawn It\\'s she who holds her tongue who gets a man Come on you poor unfortunate soul Go ahead Make your choice I\\'m a very busy woman and I haven\\'t got all day It won\\'t cost much Just your voice! You poor unfortunate soul It\\'s sad but true If you want to cross the bridge, my sweet You\\'ve got the pay the toll Take a gulp and take a breath And go ahead and sign the scroll Flotsam, Jetsam, now I\\'ve got her, boys The boss is on a roll This poor unfortunate soul Beluga sevruga Come winds of the Caspian Sea Larengix glaucitis Et max laryngitis La voce to me Now, sing Aa-aa-aah, a-aa-aah Keep singing!

Heave ho, thieves and beggars; never shall we die. The bell has been raised from its watery grave, hear its sepulchral tone. A call to all; pay heed the squall, and turn your sails to home. Yo ho, haul together, hoist the colors high. Heave ho, thieves and beggars; never shall we die. Yo ho, haul together, hoist the colors high. Heave ho, thieves and beggars; never shall we die.

So many times out there I\\'ve watched a happy pair of lovers walking in the night They had a kind of glow around them It almost looked like heaven\\'s light I knew I\\'d never know that warm and loving glow Though I might wish with all my might No face as hideous as my face Was ever meant for heaven\\'s light But suddenly an angel has smiled at me And kissed my cheek without a trace of fright I dare to dream that she might even care for me And as I ring these bells tonight My cold dark tower seems so bright I swear it must be Heaven\\'s light Confiteor deo omnipotenti (I confess to God almighty) Beatae Mariae semper virgini (To blessed Mary ever virgin) Beato Michaeli archangelo (To the blessed Archangel Michael) Sanctis apostolis omnibus sanctis (To the Holy Apostles, to all the saints) Beata Maria, you know I am a righteous man Of my virtue I am justly proud Et tibit Pater (And to you, Father) Beata Maria, you know I\\'m so much purer than The common, vulgar, weak, licentious crowd Quia peccavi nimis (That I have sinned) Then tell me, Maria, why I see her dancing there?

Morning in Paris, the city awakes To the bells of Notre Dame The fisherman fishes, the bakerman bakes To the bells of Notre Dame To the big bells as loud as the thunder To the little bells soft as a psalm And some say the soul of the city is The toll of the bells The bells of Notre Dame Dark was the night when our tale was begun On the docks near Notre Dame Four frightened gypsies slid silently under The docks near Notre Dame But a trap had been laid for the gypsies And they gazed up in fear and alarm At a figure whose clutches Were iron as much as the bells The bells of Notre Dame (Kyrie Eleison) Judge Claude Frollo longed To purge the world Of vice and sin (Kyrie Eleison) And he saw corruption Ev\\'rywhere Except within Dies irae, dies illa (Dies irae, dies illa) Dies irae, dies illa (Dies irae, dies illa) Solvet saeclum in favilla Teste David cum sibylla Quantus tremor est futurus Quando Judex est venturus See there the innocent blood you have spilt On the steps of Notre Dame Now you would add this child\\'s blood to your guilt On the steps of Notre Dame You can lie to yourself and your minions You can claim that you haven\\'t a qualm But you never can run from Nor hide what you\\'ve done from the eyes The very eyes of Notre Dame (Kyrie Eleison) And for one time in his live Of power and control (Kyrie Eleison) Frollo felt a twinge of fear For his immortal soul Just so he\\'s kept locked away Where no one else can see Even this foul creature may Yet prove one day to be Of use to me Now here is a riddle to guess if you can Sing the bells of Notre Dame Who is the monster and who is the man Sing the bells, bells, bells, bells Bells, bells, bells, bells Bells of Notre Dame I can show you the world Shining, shimmering, splendid Tell me, princess, now when did You last let your heart decide? I can open your eyes Take you wonder by wonder Over, sideways and under On a magic carpet ride A whole new world A new fantastic point of view No one to tell us no or where to go Or say we\\'re only dreaming A whole new world A dazzling place I never knew But when I\\'m way up here, it\\'s crystal clear That now I\\'m in a whole new world with you Now I\\'m in a whole new world with you Unbelievable sights Indescribable feeling Soaring, tumbling, freewheeling Through an endless diamond sky A whole new world Don\\'t you dare close your eyes A hundred thousand things to see (Hold your breath, it gets better) I\\'m like a shooting star I\\'ve come so far I can\\'t go back To where I used to be A whole new world Every turn a surprise With new horizons to pursue Every moment red-letter I\\'ll chase them anywhere There\\'s time to spare Let me share this whole new world with you A whole new world That\\'s where we\\'ll be A thrilling chase A wondrous place For you and me Somewhere out there, Beneath the pale moonlight, Someone\\'s thinking of me, And loving me tonight. Somewhere out there, Someone\\'s saying a prayer, That we\\'ll find one another, In that big somewhere out there. And even though I know how very far apart we are, It helps to think we might be wishing on the same bright star, And when the night wind starts to sing a lonesome lullaby, It helps to think we\\'re sleeping underneath the same big sky! Somewhere out there, If love can see us through, Then we\\'ll be together, Somewhere out there, Out where dreams Come true...

Should I marry Kocoum? Is all my dreaming at an end? Or do you still wait for me, dream giver Just around the river bend?

Hakuna Matata Hakuna Matata Hakuna Matata Hakuna It means no worries For the rest of your days It\\'s our problem-free philosophy Hakuna Matata From the day we arrive on the planet And blinking, step into the sun There\\'s more to see than can ever be seen More to do than can ever be done There\\'s far too much to take in here More to find than can ever be found But the sun rolling high Through the sapphire sky Keeps great and small on the endless round It\\'s the circle of life And it moves us all Through despair and hope Through faith and love Till we find our place On the path unwinding In the circle The circle of life It\\'s the circle of life And it moves us all Through despair and hope Through faith and love Till we find our place On the path unwinding In the circle The circle of life Mmmmmm Mmmmmm So this is love Mmmmmm So this is love So this is what makes life divine I\\'m all aglow, mmmmmm And now I know And now I know The key to all heaven is mine My heart has wings, mmmmmm And I can fly I\\'ll touch every star in the sky So this is the miracle That I\\'ve been dreaming of Mmmmmm Mmmmmm So this is love Oh, this is the night, it\\'s a beautiful night And we call it bella notte Look at the skies, they have stars in their eyes On this lovely bella notte Side by side with your loved one You\\'ll find enchantment here The night will weave its magic spell When the one you love is near For this is the night, and the heavens are right On this lovely bella notte This is the night, it\\'s a beautiful night And we call it bella notte Look at the skies, they have stars in their eyes On this lovely bella notte Side by side with your loved one You\\'ll find enchantment here The night will weave its magic spell When the one you love is near For this is the night, and the heavens are right On this lovely bella notte Look at me, I will never pass for a perfect bride, or a perfect daughter. Can it be, I\\'m not meant to play this part? Now I see, that if I were truly to be myself, I would break my family\\'s heart. Who is that girl I see, staring straight back at me? Why is my reflection someone I don\\'t know? Somehow I cannot hide Who I am, though I\\'ve tried. When will my reflection show, who I am, inside? How I pray, that a time will come, I can free myself, from their expectations On that day, I\\'ll discover someway to be myself, and to make my family proud. They want a docile lamb, No-one knows who I am. Must there be a secret me, I\\'m forced to hide? Must I pretend that I am someone else for all time? When will my reflection show, who I am inside? When will my reflection show, who I am inside? I know you I walked with you Once Upon a dream I know you That gleam in your eyes Is so familiar a gleam Yet I know it\\'s true That visions are seldom what they seem But if I know you I know what you do You\\'ll love me at once The way you did once upon a dream La da la da la ahahahahah But if I know you I know what you do You\\'ll love me at once The way you did once upon a dream I know you I walked with you Once Upon a dream I know you That gleam in your eyes Is so familiar a gleam Yet I know it\\'s true That visions are seldom what they seem But if I know you I know what you do You\\'ll love me at once The way you did once upon a dream There\\'s a calm surrender to the rush of day When the heat of the rolling world can be turned away An enchanted moment and it sees me through It\\'s enough for this restless warrior just to be with you And can you feel the love tonight? It is where we are It\\'s enough for this wide-eyed wanderer that we got this far And can you feel the love tonight?

this is where I\\'m meant to be I\\'ll be there someday, I can go the distance I will find my way if I can be strong I know every mile would be worth my while When I go the distance, I\\'ll be right where I belong Down an unknown road to embrace my fate Though that road may wander, it will lead me to you And a thousand years would be worth the wait It might take a lifetime but somehow I\\'ll see it through And I won\\'t look back, I can go the distance And I\\'ll stay on track, no I won\\'t accept defeat It\\'s an uphill slope But I won\\'t loose hope, \\'till I go the distance And my journey is complete, oh yeah But to look beyond the glory is the hardest part For a hero\\'s strength is measured by his heart, oh Like a shooting star, I will go the distance I will search the world, I will face its harms I don\\'t care how far, I can go the distance \\'Till I find my hero\\'s welcome waiting in your arms I will search the world, I will face its harms \\'Till I find my hero\\'s welcome

crying It will be alright Just take my hand And hold it tight I will protect you From all around you I will be here Don\\'t you cry For one so small, You seem so strong My arms will hold you, Keep you

The midnite hour is close at hand Creatures crawl in search of blood To terrorize y\\'awl\\'s neighbourhood And whosoever shall be found Without the soul for getting down Must stand and face the

A fall down the stairs Her dress torn Oh the blood in her hair... A mystery so sullen in air She lie there so tenderly Fashioned so slenderly Lift her with care, Oh the blood in her hair... Everyone came to see The girl that now is dead So blind stare the eyes in her head... And suddenly a voice from the crowd said This girl lived in vain Her face bear such agony, such strain... But only the man from next door Knew Little Susie and how he cried As he reached down To close Susie\\'s eyes... She lie there so tenderly Fashioned so slenderly Lift her with care Oh the blood in her hair... It was all for God\\'s sake For her singing the tune For someone to feel her despair To be damned to know hoping is dead and you\\'re doomed Then to scream out And nobody\\'s there... She knew no one cared... Father left home, poor mother died Leaving Susie alone Grandfather\\'s soul too had flown... No one to care Just to love her How much can one bear Rejecting the needs in her prayers... Neglection can kill Like a knife in your soul Oh it will Little Susie fought so hard to live...

Surrounded by gloom Invaded by shadows Painting the The light from the window Cuts through the air And pins the child lying there Scared of the moon She pulls up the covers And shivers in fright She hides from the color That rides on the night The light through the window That lights up the sky And causes her mournful cry Scared of the moon There\\'s nothing wrong Don\\'t be bothered they said It\\'s just childish fantasies turning your head No need to worry It\\'s really too soon But there she lies shivering Scared of the moon Scared of the moon Scared of the moon Scared of the moon Scared of the moon The years go by swiftly And soon childhood ends But life is still fearful When evening descends The fear of a child Still intrudes the night Returning on beams of light Scared of the moon The feeling of terror She felt as a youth Has turned from a fantasy Into the truth The moon is the enemy Twisting her soul And taking its fearful toll Scared of the moon But now there are others who sit in a room And wait for the sunlight to brighten their gloom Together they gather Their lunacy shade But knowing just why they\\'re scared Scared of the moon Scared of the moon Scared of the moon Scared of the moon Scared of the moon All alone wishing on stars Waiting for you to find me One sweet night I knew I would see A stranger who\\'d be my friend When someone in the dark reaches out to you And touches off a spark that comes shining through It tells you never be afraid Then somewhere in your heart you can feel the glow A light to keep you warm when the night winds blow Like it was written in the stars I knew My friend, my someone in the dark was you Promise me we\\'ll always be Walking the world together Hand in hand where dreams never end My star secret friend and me When someone in the dark reaches out to you And touches off a spark that comes shining through It tells you never be afraid Then somewhere in your heart you can feel the glow A light to keep you warm when the night winds blow Look for the rainbow in the sky I believe you and I Could never really say goodbye Wherever you may be I\\'ll look up and see Someone in the dark for me Wherever you may be I\\'ll look up and see Someone in the dark for me Though you\\'re gone star far away Each time I see a rainbow I\\'ll remember being with you Smiles coming through my tears When someone in the dark reaches out for you And touches off a spark that comes shining through It tells you never be afraid Then somewhere in your heart you can feel the glow A light to keep you warm when the night winds blow Look for the rainbow in the sky I believe you and I Could never really say goodbye Wherever you may be I\\'ll look up and see Someone in the dark for me Wherever you may be I\\'ll look up and see Someone in the dark for me!

And all the people that come and go Stop and say \"Hello\". On the corner is a banker with a motorcar, And little children laugh at him behind his back. And the banker never wears a mac In the pouring rain, very strange. Penny Lane is in my ears and in my eyes. There beneath the blue suburban skies I sit, and meanwhile back In Penny Lane there is a fireman with an hourglass, And in his pocket is a portrait of the Queen. He likes to keep his fire engine clean, It\\'s a clean machine. Penny Lane is in my ears and in my eyes. A four of fish and finger pies In summer. Meanwhile back Behind the shelter in the middle of the roundabout The pretty nurse is selling poppies from a tray. And though she feels as if she\\'s in a play, She is anyway. In Penny Lane the barber shaves another customer, We see the banker sitting waiting for a trim, And then the fireman rushes in From the pouring rain - very strange. Penny Lane is in my ears and in my eyes. There beneath the blue suburban skies I sit, and meanwhile back. Penny Lane is in my ears and in my eyes. There beneath the blue suburban skies Penny Lane!
